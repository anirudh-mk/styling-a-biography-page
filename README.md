# Project brief

The following live example shows a biography, which has been styled using CSS. The CSS properties that are used are as follows — each one links to its property page on MDN, which will give you more examples of its use. <br/>

- font-family 
- color
- border-bottom
- font-weight 
- font-size
- font-style
- text-decoration <br/>

In the interactive editor you will find some CSS already in place. This selects parts of the document using element selectors, classes, and pseudo-classes. Make the following changes to this CSS: <br/>

1. Make the level one heading pink, using the CSS color keyword hotpink.
2. Give the heading a 10px dotted border-bottom which uses the CSS color keyword purple.
3. Make the level 2 heading italic.
4. Give the ul used for the contact details a background-color of #eeeeee, and a 5px solid purple border. Use some padding to push the content away from the border.
5.Make the links green on hover.

## Hints and tips

Use the W3C CSS Validator to catch unintended mistakes in your CSS — mistakes you might have otherwise missed — so that you can fix them.
Afterwards try looking up some properties not mentioned on this page in the MDN CSS reference and get adventurous!
Remember that there is no wrong answer here — at this stage in your learning you can afford to have a bit of fun.
